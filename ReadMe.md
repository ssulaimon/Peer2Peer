# CREATING PEER TO PEER SYSTEM CONTRACT
-   Main function of the contract
    * The Contract would basically live on the blockchain,
    * Allowing anyone irrespective of thier country/location to create market order and also buy order
    * Requirement for anyone to interact with this contract would be a crypto wallet depending on the 
        blockchain the contract is deployed
    * Peer privacy is very important as the contract does not require KYC of it user
    * How do peers trust each other? their would be rating system which can viewed using address to know 
        how well behaved a peer has been.
    * What would happen instance of dispute? since the contract is not been controlled by a central 
        authority to blacklist address
        The solution to this would be creating moderators
        Who are moderators? Moderators would be in charge making the system fair and balance.
        In other to be a Moderator a token would be created having a non-fixed supply.
        To become a moderator the user is expected to stake a certain amount of this token(This would
        be kept low in other to have larger number of moderators).
        Having a pool would help because moderators would be selected randomly to settle dispute.
        Random selection because both seller and buyer would have no clue who the moderators is for fair judgement.For every dispute resolved moderator would earn trading fee for the trade. Any moderator found been mallicious would have their stake been slash, if lower than requirement after been slashed moderator would be kickded out.
        Also moderator stake would be earning reward for been staked in the system.
        Also any user found guilty would be punished by having their rating been deducted, tendency of having negative rating is plausible.
